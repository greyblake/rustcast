# Iterators

[See the video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgFWz0jgqMU)

Implement an iterator, that traverse vector of integers and produces those items,
which follow an odd number.

Example:
Vector: 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 9, 0, 3

Produced items:
* 6 (after 5)
* 1 (after 7)
* 9 (after 1)
* 0 (after 9)
